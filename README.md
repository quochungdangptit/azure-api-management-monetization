# Azure API Management - Monetization

## Purpose and scope

This is a **demo project** providing two working examples of how to integrate Azure API Management (APIM) with payment providers - one based on integration with [Stripe](https://stripe.com/), the other with [Adyen](https://www.adyen.com/).

The objective is to show how you can enable consumers to discover an API that you wish to make public, enter their payment details, activate their subscription and trigger automated payment based on their usage of the API.

To use this demo, you will need to deploy the solution into your own Azure subscription and to set up your own Stripe / Adyen account.  This is **not** a managed service - you will be responsible for managing the resources that are deployed on Azure, adapting the solution to meet your specific use case and keeping the solution up to date.

## Steps to follow

Follow these steps to implement the demo project:

1. Read [Monetization with Azure API Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/api-management/monetization-overview) to get background about designing a successful monetization strategy.

1. Read [How API Management supports monetization](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/api-management/monetization-support) to understand how APIM supports implementation of a monetization strategy.

1. Choose the payment provider you want to implement - either [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) or [Adyen](https://www.adyen.com/).

1. Read the overview: either [How to implement monetization with Azure API Management and Stripe](./documentation/stripe-details.md) or [How to implement monetization with Azure API Management and Adyen](./documentation/adyen-details.md) to understand more about Stripe / Adyen, how they integrate with APIM, the architecture adopted and the consumer flow through the solution.

1. Follow the deployment instructions in either [Deploy demo with Stripe](./documentation/stripe-deploy.md) or [Deploy demo with Adyen](./documentation/adyen-deploy.md) to set up the pre-requisites, deploy the resources onto Azure and complete remaining steps post deployment to implement the demo project.

1. Reference [Deployment details](./documentation/deployment-details.md) to get more detail about the resources that are being deployed and how this has been scripted.

1. Reference [Advanced steps](./documentation/advanced-steps.md) if you want to modify the infrastructure templates or run the billing app locally.

## Architecture

The following diagram illustrates the high level architecture this demo has adopted to integrate API Management with a payment provider, showing the components of the solution across APIM, the Billing App (both hosted on Azure) and the payment provider.  It also highlights the major integration flows between components, including the interactions between the API Consumer (both developer and application) and the solution:
